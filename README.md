SentimentSentinel is a Discord bot that uses VADER sentiment analysis to track the positivity vs. negativity of messages sent by users in a guild. 

In theory, guild managers could use this information to issue warnings to overly toxic users.

The bot is not online for public use. To run the bot, you have to creat
e a bot using the discord developer portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications/), get an OAuth2 link and add the bot to your server, and create a .env file containing the line "DISCORD_TOKEN={TOKEN}", whe
re {token} is your bot's token.
